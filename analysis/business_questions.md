# Business Analysis Questions

This document outlines the strategic business questions addressed in this project.
Each question is answered using structured SQL queries across normalized relational tables.

## Data Validation & Quality Assurance
To ensure analytical reliability and reporting accuracy, the following validation checks were performed:
- How many total records exist in each table to confirm successful data ingestion?
- Are there missing values in critical revenue-impacting fields (order_id, user_id, total_amount)?
- Are there duplicate primary key values that could distort financial reporting?
- Are there order items with zero or negative quantity values indicating data entry errors?
- Are there products with invalid pricing (zero or negative values)?
- Do all order_items records have a valid parent order (referential integrity validation)?

## Revenue Analysis
This section evaluates overall financial performance and growth patterns:
- What is the total revenue generated from completed orders?
- What is the month-over-month revenue growth rate?
- Are there observable seasonal revenue patterns?
- Is revenue concentrated among a small percentage of customers?
- What percentage of total revenue is generated by the top 10% of customers?
- Does the business face revenue concentration risk due to dependence on high-value customers?

## Order Analysis
This section examines transactional behavior and purchasing trends:
- What is the Average Order Value (AOV)?
- How many completed orders are placed each month?
- Are there seasonal fluctuations in order volume?
- How does order frequency trend over time?
- Is order growth aligned with revenue growth?

## Sales & Product Performance
This section evaluates product-level and category-level contribution:
- Which products generate the highest total revenue?
- Which products sell the highest quantity?
- How does revenue distribution vary across product categories?
- Which categories contribute the largest share of total revenue?
- Which categories underperform relative to portfolio averages?

## Customer Analysis
This section analyzes customer value and segmentation:
- Who are the top 5 customers generating the highest revenue?
- What proportion of customers are one-time buyers versus repeat buyers?
- How much revenue is generated by repeat customers compared to one-time buyers?
- What percentage of total revenue is driven by repeat customers?
- Is revenue highly dependent on a small segment of high-value customers?
